# COVID-19 SQL and Excel Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was undertaken to enhance my skills in SQL and Excel by analyzing a real-world dataset. I chose to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic due to its global significance and the valuable insights it can provide. In particular, I wanted to examine how the pandemic affected Africa, a continent that holds personal significance to me.

## Why This Project?
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted different regions of the world in unique ways. Living in the U.S., I noticed that there was relatively little coverage about how African countries were dealing with the pandemic. This motivated me to explore the situation in African nations specifically. Through this project, I aimed to:

- Gain hands-on experience with a complex dataset featuring multiple metrics.
- Use SQL to extract and analyze key trends, such as death rates, total cases, and recovery rates.
- Utilize Excel to visualize these trends, making the findings accessible and insightful.
  
By focusing on Africa, I combined my personal interest with technical skills development, creating a project that is both meaningful and data-driven.

## Key Insights from SQL Queries
Below are the key findings from the analysis, accompanied by visual representations made using Excel.

### 1. Total Cases by Country
This bar chart highlights the African countries with the highest total COVID-19 cases, sorted in descending order. It helps to quickly identify the countries most impacted by the pandemic in terms of total cases.

### 2. Countries with High Deaths Per Capita
This visualization shows countries where deaths per million population exceed 500. It provides insight into the severity of the pandemic relative to each country's population size.

### 3. Active Cases vs. Recovered Cases
This chart compares active cases to recovered cases, offering insights into the proportion of ongoing cases versus recoveries. It reflects how well countries have managed the pandemic, showing whether most cases are still active or the majority have recovered.

### 4. Mortality Rate Calculation
This heatmap visualizes the mortality rates across different countries, helping to identify those with the highest death rates. It’s a key indicator of how severe the pandemic has been in certain regions.

### 5. Total Cases by Region
This bar chart displays the total COVID-19 cases across different African regions. It highlights that the southern and northern regions of Africa were the most affected, offering a regional perspective on the pandemic’s spread.
